 * - Enabled when the plugin is unconfigured (no initial configuration and no
 *   save request in this session), so the user can request the defaults.
 * - Enabled when the working state differs from the last-requested snapshot
 *   (dirty), so a pending edit can always be committed.
 * - Disabled otherwise: a configured plugin with no pending edits has
 *   nothing to save.
